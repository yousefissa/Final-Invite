# Final Queue bumping script.

This script bumps you up in queue, from 200-400k+ to the 100-500 in just a few minutes.

### There are two versions - a requests version and Selenium version. The requests version is 10x easier to run.

Run final_requests.py, put your referral url in, and you're done.


## Selenium Version Requirements

Make sure to have Selenium installed. Furthermore, you will need the PhantomJS driver. Download it from here:

http://phantomjs.org

Move the PhantomJS to the path folder and simply run the bot. It will let you know when accounts have been registered. Check your queue status on getfinal.com

## Please note that after awhile, referrals no longer bump you up in rank and you will simply need to wait.
